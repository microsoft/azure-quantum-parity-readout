# What to contribute

As the source code included in this repository is intended to reproduce the figures as they
appear in the Nature publication "Interferometric Single-Shot Parity Measurement in an InAs-Al
Hybrid Device", we anticipate no significant revisions in the functionality of the
code. However, we welcome any contributions or suggestions that do not substantially alter the
results. These may include, for example, changes to ensure compatibility with future versions
of Python, Julia, or any other dependencies; bug fixes that ensure compatibility with platforms
beyond those on which this repository was originally tested; and improvements to the performance
of the simulation codes.
